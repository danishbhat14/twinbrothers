<br/>
        <p>
          If you ever want to find paradise on earth, it can only and truly be Kashmir. In the 17th century, Mughal Emperor Jahangir was so mesmerized by the beauty of the place that he said, “If there is a paradise anywhere on the earth, it is here, it is here, it is here.”
        </p><br/>
        <p>
          Kashmir offers varied varieties of activities and exploration that can be done such as trekking, mountaineering, rock climbing, camping, skiing, and paragliding. The duration of our Kashmir Trip takes 5 days to complete starting from Srinagar and ending at Srinagar.
        </p><br/>
        <p>
          Get ready to be enchanted by beautiful valleys, crystal clear lakes, wildlife, and local handicrafts. We start off our journey from the summer capital of Kashmir, Srinagar. At Srinagar, you can either choose to rest at your hotel or do some sightseeing and shopping at the local markets.

While in Pahalgam, you can visit Betaab Valley, Sheshnaag Lake, Tarsar, and Marsar Lake which has one of the most famous treks in India.

          Our last location of the trip would be Sonmarg which is rightfully known as the “Meadow of Gold”.

You can visit Nilagrad River which is a highly revered river for the locals. This river also contains many medicinal and healing properties, so make sure not to miss out on this place while you are at Sonmarg.
