<br/>
        <p>
          If you ever want to find paradise on earth, it can only and truly be Kashmir. In the 17th century, Mughal Emperor Jahangir was so mesmerized by the beauty of the place that he said, “If there is a paradise anywhere on the earth, it is here, it is here, it is here.”
        </p><br/>
        <p>
          Kashmir offers varied varieties of activities and exploration that can be done such as trekking, mountaineering, rock climbing, camping, skiing, and paragliding. The duration of our Kashmir Trip takes 5 days to complete starting from Srinagar and ending at Srinagar.
        </p><br/>
        <p>
          Get ready to be enchanted by beautiful valleys, crystal clear lakes, wildlife, and local handicrafts. We start off our journey from the summer capital of Kashmir, Srinagar. At Srinagar, you can either choose to rest at your hotel or do some sightseeing and shopping at the local markets.
        </p><br/>
        <p>
          You can shop for pashminas, carved wooden boxes, Kashmiri carpets, and the world-famous Kashmiri Saffron. Take in every bit of authentic Kashmiri cuisine when you stop by their famous eateries in the market. Kashmiri food is considered as the pinnacle of culinary excellence with their famous spices and rich color.

        <p>
          We’ll visit Gulmarg the next day which is another beautiful location of Kashmir Valley.

While in Gulmarg, you can experience a trip to one of the highest cable cars in the world, which is also known as “Gondola” around these parts. Also, for all the golf aficionados out there, you can visit the Gulmarg Golf Course which is quite possibly one of the most beautiful golf courses in the world.
        </p><br/>
        <p>
          The next day we’ll be going off to Pahalgam which is also known as the “Valley of Shepherds”. The place has a really serene vibe to it, and therefore many movies have been shot at Pahalgam. While in Pahalgam, you can visit Betaab Valley, Sheshnaag Lake, Tarsar, and Marsar Lake which has one of the most famous treks in India. Enjoy a peaceful evening at Pahalgam before returning back to your hotel.
        </p><br/>
        <p>
          Our last location of the trip would be Sonmarg which is rightfully known as the “Meadow of Gold”. One of the most famous attractions of Sonmarg is “Thajiwas Glacier” which has crystal clear waterfalls and green meadows welcoming you. You can visit Nilagrad River which is a highly revered river for the locals. This river also contains many medicinal and healing properties, so make sure not to miss out on this place while you are at Sonmarg.
